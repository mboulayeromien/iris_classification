# iris_classification
This project is about Classifying the species of Iris flower based on the measures of the following(all in centimeters):
1. SepalLength
2. SepalWidth
3. PetalLength
4. PetalWidth
The above mentioned are the independent variables.
In the dataset, the Species attribute is the target/dependent variable

Pandas has been used for loading the data
seaborn has been used for visualizing the trends in the data

I have used the RidgeClassifier algorithm for model building

Classification report gives the precision, recall, accuracy of the model.
And finally, the model can now be used to predict the species of the iris flower(setosa, versicolor, or, virginica
